reported jeff masters weather nsidc usually hemispheres generally practice looking global sea ice said mark director national snow ice data reason ice two hemispheres tends behave rather arctic extent shows clear trends pattern antarctic much
overall shape combined plot presented shows contribution sea ice antarctic typically reaches highest extent northern hemisphere arctic typically reaches highest extent northern hemisphere
reason dramatic year arctic antarctic experiencing low conditions time rare
experts agree cause low sea ice hemisphere likely caused different
year especially warm terms air temperature sea reported line trend reduced sea october november typically time rapid ice gain arctic hours become eventually whats referred
air temperatures zero degrees fahrenheit parts arctic ocean covered ice quickly become
air temperatures staying much closer freezing mark degrees
make matters water temperatures arctic ocean several degrees expected result less sea
less ice heat darker opposed back space white ice
result feedback one scientists warned
unexpected finding loss sea ice antarctica
unlike antarctic sea ice generally increasing year year past couple despite overall warming trends
nothing like due open ocean circulation around lack land factors make understanding trends difficult
finding discussed antarctic climate researchers september post antarctica also broken new climate record low winter sea
peak million square late sea ice began month ahead schedule setting daily low records
authors suggest factors may play role reduced sea including changing wind patterns warmer ocean water rising ultimately climate remains currently trying see picture pieces still
